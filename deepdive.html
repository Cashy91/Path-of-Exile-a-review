        Class system! <br>
        <br>
One big part of the class system that sets it apart from many other games in the same genre is that when you fick your class you do not lock yourself into a different style of play.
Since all classes can use every item, attack or spell.
The biggest part of your choice is where you begin in your passive skill tree wich we will cover in the next section. 
All classes uses the same tree but u have different starting location.
Another part wich is locked in based on your class is later in the game when you choose your sub-class.
All the base classes have three to pick between and its there where you really pick what type of specialisation.
There is 6 base classes and one more that u can unlock later in the game.
In the next part we will take a look at the sub-classes.

        Acendancy system!<br><br>

Abit into your journey through Wreyclast you will begin to encounter areas wich have trails of acendancy. This is a type of test for you to prepere for what is to come before you unlock your sub-class. The area is a mini-sized labrint with traps. 
Before you can enter your first labrinth you will need to do six trails.
Afer this you can enter Sarns labrith. Its here where you will need to traverse through the labrith paths and fight its mighty leader at three different stages to finally we rewarded with your acandancy class of choice.
Every class have its own three sub-classes to pick from and they all have their own strenths and weaknesses.
Through your adventures you will be able to ascend  a total of four times and in the process choose 2 points to add to your specific ascendancytree. Each time will require you to do more trails and the labrith will get harder each time.
