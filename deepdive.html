       The Class system
    </div>
    <div class="deepdive-text"> 
One big part of the class system that sets it apart from many other games in the same genre is that when you fick your class you do not lock yourself into a different style of play.
Since all classes can use every item, attack or spell.
The biggest part of your choice is where you begin in your passive skill tree wich we will cover in the next section. 
All classes uses the same tree but u have different starting location.
Another part wich is locked in based on your class is later in the game when you choose your sub-class.
All the base classes have three to pick between and its there where you really pick what type of specialisation.
There is 6 base classes and one more that u can unlock later in the game.
In the next part we will take a look at the sub-classes.

    <div class="headline">
        The Acendancy system
    </div>
    <div class="deepdive-text">
Abit into your journey through Wreyclast you will begin to encounter areas wich have trails of acendancy. This is a type of test for you to prepere for what is to come before you unlock your sub-class. The area is a mini-sized labrint with traps. 
Before you can enter your first labrinth you will need to do six trails.
Afer this you can enter Sarns labrith. Its here where you will need to traverse through the labrith paths and fight its mighty leader at three different stages to finally we rewarded with your acandancy class of choice.
Every class have its own three sub-classes to pick from and they all have their own strenths and weaknesses.
Through your adventures you will be able to ascend  a total of four times and in the process choose 2 points to add to your specific ascendancytree. Each time will require you to do more trails and the labrith will get harder each time.

    <div class="headline">
        The currency and crafting system
    </div>
    <div class="deepdive-text">    
This is a big part that sets Path of exile apart from other games. There is no money in the game. Instead you will receive crafting materials through your journey and have the choice between using it yourself or trading with other exiles to get your hands on gear upgrades and other items. 
There is alot to choose from depending on what you want to do. 
For example many gear slots comes with sockets wich you insert your gems into to enable you to use attacks and spells.
You can then support those gems with others to effect them in different ways.
With currency u can change socket numbers, linking those together to make your spells more powerful.
There is other currencys wich you can use to randomly upgrade a item and have a chanse to make it something fantastic or it can be destroyed.
If you are going to play in the latter stages of the campaign and beyond u will see the crafting system taking on a big part of your playtime and its something you can really sink your teeth in.
