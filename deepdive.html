        Class system! <br>
        <br>
One big part of the class system that sets it apart from many other games in the same genre is that when you fick your class you do not lock yourself into a different style of play.
Since all classes can use every item, attack or spell.
The biggest part of your choice is where you begin in your passive skill tree wich we will cover in the next section. 
All classes uses the same tree but u have different starting location.
Another part wich is locked in based on your class is later in the game when you choose your sub-class.
All the base classes have three to pick between and its there where you really pick what type of specialisation.
There is 6 base classes and one more that u can unlock later in the game.
In the next part we will take a look at the sub-classes.
