             Overview
        </h2>
        <p>
            In Path of exile you are washed ashore on the beach of Wreyclast. 
You have been condamed to a life as a slave for your crimes in Oriath.
As you begin to make your journey through Wreyclast you discover the untaped power within you. <br>
You also discover there is a waste aray of different gems wich give you power through attacks and spells, a great way to cuztomise your character to your liking.<br>
What really set Path of Exile apart from many other games is its skill tree wich includes hundreds of nodes that difers in power. Its also another way to really make your character your own.<br>
As you making your way through the acts you will discover several secrets and choices that inpact your character in multiple ways. You will get the choice to dive deeper into your class and explore the different sub-classes. <br>
Another part that sets Path of exile apart from its counterparts is that there is no gold in the game. The currency is all the crafting materials that you find in your journey. 
So you will need to make a choice to use it yourself or trade with other exiles for upgrades and other items.
<br>
So are you ready  o step into the arena and forge your fate?
