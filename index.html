What really set Path of Exile apart from many other games is its skill tree wich includes hundreds of nodes that difers in power. Its also another way to really make your character your own.<br>
As you making your way through the acts you will discover several secrets and choices that inpact your character in multiple ways. You will get the choice to dive deeper into your class and explore the different sub-classes. <br>
